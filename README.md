# CinemaNet

CinemaNet is a set of data and trained models to help run inference to classify images / frames of a video with an eye for photographic, cinemgraphic, composition and color labelling.

CinemaNet aims to give out of the box useful classification of images / frames of video to cinematographers, editors, archivists, and anyone interested in extracting classification in a cinema / video context.
