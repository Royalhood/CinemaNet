# CinemaNet

CinemaNet is a set of data and trained models to help run inference to classify images / frames of a video with common Cinematography terms.

CinemaNet aims to give out of the box useful classification of images / frames of video to cinematographers, editors, archivists, and anyone interested in extracting classification in a cinema / video context.

CinemaNet also attempts to standardize other models and data sets to use a single representation for inference/classificiation. CinemaNet provides various trained models on other data sets we find useful for film/photographic classification.
